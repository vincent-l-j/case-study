## Overview and Origin

The plan for Celsius Network was drawn up on a coffee shop napkin in 2017 by its founders, Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon.
[^1]
Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky has founded eight startups and several multi-billion-dollar businesses including Arbinet, Transit Wireless and GroundLink.
[^2]
Daniel Leon is the President and COO of Celsius and has co-founded and led multiple companies and not-for-profit organizations, including Beyon3D, Atlis Labs, and Governing Dynamics.
[^3]
The idea for Celsius came about after considering that traditional banks only reward their customers with interest rates as low as 1% or less but knowing they could potentially offer more.
Celsius' mission statement is: "To put unparalleled economic freedom in the hands of the people."
[^4]
Celsius held their initial coin offering (ICO) of their CEL token back in 2018 and raised $50 million.

## Business Activities

Most banks typically make between 14-25% return on their capital, so by paying customers 1% in interest, theyâ€™re keeping over 80% of the profits and distributing these earnings to their shareholders, usually in the form of dividends and share buyback.
[^6]
The Celsius business model is structured to do the exact opposite of what banks do - by giving 80% of total revenue back to their community each week in the form of earned interest.
This effectively gives users similar privileges to shareholders.

Celsius Network serves as a wallet platform to deposit crypto assets, earn interest, and borrow 1% cash loans.
[^7]
By depositing crypto assets with Celsius, users can earn up to 17% yield on said assets, paid weekly.

Celsius' main sources of income include:
- Institutional lending
[^8]
- Providing liquidity to exchanges
[^2]
- Retail lending
[^8]
- DeFi staking
[^9]
- Mining BTC
[^10]

According to PointPay, the market for crypto loans, where bitcoin and stablecoins are pledged as collateral, is estimated at approximately $ 30-35 billion in 2021.

With over 1 million users and over $27.5 billion assets under management, Celsius' intended customers include both individual retail investors and institutional investors.

Celsius offers competitively high interest rate to users, allowing over 10% interest on stable coins like USDC and USDT. Other companies like BlockFi and Nexo only offer less than 9% on stable coins. Other interest rates can be seen below:

To ensure the security of its assets under management, Celsius Network uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC) through its custodian, Fireblocks, which also allows them to have insurance for funds stored in Hot wallets.
