## Overview and Origin

The plan for Celsius Network was drawn up on a coffee shop napkin in 2017 by its founders, Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon.
[^1]
Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky has founded eight startups and several multi-billion-dollar businesses including Arbinet, Transit Wireless and GroundLink.
[^2]
Daniel Leon is the President and COO of Celsius and has co-founded and led multiple companies and not-for-profit organizations, including Beyon3D, Atlis Labs, and Governing Dynamics.
[^3]
The idea for Celsius came about after considering that traditional banks only reward their customers with interest rates as low as 1% or less but knowing they could potentially offer more.
Celsius' mission statement is: "To put unparalleled economic freedom in the hands of the people."
[^4]
Celsius held their initial coin offering (ICO) of their CEL token back in 2018 and raised $50 million.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Most banks typically make between 14-25% return on their capital, so by paying customers 1% in interest, they’re keeping over 80% of the profits and distributing these earnings to their shareholders, usually in the form of dividends and share buyback.
[^6]
The Celsius business model is structured to do the exact opposite of what banks do - by giving 80% of total revenue back to their community each week in the form of earned interest.

Celsius Network serves as a wallet platform to deposit crypto assets, earn interest, and borrow 1% cash loans.
[^7]
By depositing crypto assets with Celsius, users can earn up to 17% yield on said assets, paid weekly.

Celsius' main sources of income include:
- Institutional lending

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The Celsius' intended customers are both individual retail investors and institutional investors.
However, they also serve  as part of their normal business opertions.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
