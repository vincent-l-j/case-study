The plan for Celsius Network was drawn up on a coffee shop napkin in 2017 by its founders, Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon.

Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky has founded eight startups and several multi-billion-dollar businesses including Arbinet, Transit Wireless and GroundLink.
[^2]
Daniel Leon is the President and COO of Celsius and has co-founded and led multiple companies and not-for-profit organizations, including Beyon3D, Atlis Labs, and Governing Dynamics.

The idea for Celsius came about after considering that traditional banks only reward their customers with interest rates as low as 1% or less but knowing they could potentially offer more.
Celsius' mission statement is: "To put unparalleled economic freedom in the hands of the people."

Celsius held their initial coin offering (ICO) of their CEL token back in 2018 and raised $50 million.
